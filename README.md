## Taster: Why I Blog

I once read a blogger who, upon introducing themselves at a party, was drawn into
a lively discussion about some subject that he had written about in
his blog. The way he described it: writing a blog is a way of starting
conversations with people you haven't yet met.

But it's 2024 now, and there's heaps of stuff on the internet, in so many more
attention-grabbing forms; and so what good is a blog that is mere words on a page?
To that I say: attention-grabbing material is ephemeral, and does not lend the material to
examiniation, critique and improvement. Writing a blog is a way of sharpening my
thoughts - now your thoughts, together.

I was younger once, and I wish the world told me what I need to know; I am older now, and I feel I can be part of creating a world there such information is available. Writing a blog is a way to make my small world wiser.

I am frighteningly mortal, and sometimes I think: If we all die, what's the point of
living? And I recall [that little parts of us die every day](https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=3388&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+smbc-comics%2FPvLb+%28Saturday+Morning+Breakfast+Cereal+%28updated+daily%29%29); and yet we go on - we are the sum total of our observations and experience, bound to our present circumstance; while the circumstance may change, our experiences are the permanent part of who we are. Writing a blog is a way for me to live on.

I would love to read your blog as well. Please write it.
